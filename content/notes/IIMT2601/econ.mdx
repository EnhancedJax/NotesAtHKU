## Platform economy


Platforms are sensitive to the [**network effect**](FIXME-def:network). The more users on the platform, the more valuable it is. This allows the platform to have a significant advantage, even when innovative entrants have better products.

<Block variant="knBox" title="Increase switching costs">
Increasing switching costs will encourage users to stay on the platform. This can be done through:

    - **Exclusivity**: Products cannot be accessed in other providers.
    - **Sunk cost**: Rewards from time and effort spent on platform
    - **Incompatibility**: Switching costs are high (e.g. learning, migration, etc.)
