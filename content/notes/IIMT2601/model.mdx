<Block variant="theorem" title="Long tail strategy">

    - Profit from selling many low-volume, unique items rather than few high-volume items
    - Particularly effective in e-commerce where:
        - No physical inventory limitations
        - Items easily discoverable online
        - Helps compete in crowded markets

    - Horizontal - By Tastes

<Block variant="theorem" title="Porter's Five Forces of Competition">

    1. Rivalry among existing firms (no. of competitors $\uparrow$ $\implies$ competition $\uparrow$)
    2. Threat of new entrants (entry barriers $\uparrow$ $\implies$ competition $\downarrow$)
    3. Bargaining power of suppliers (no. of suppliers $\uparrow$ $\implies$ dependency $\downarrow$)
    4. Bargaining power of buyers (supply $\uparrow$ power of buyers $\uparrow$)
    5. Threat of substitutes (no. of alternatives $\uparrow$ $\implies$ competition $\uparrow$)
