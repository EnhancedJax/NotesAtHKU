<Block variant="knowledge" title="Revenue strategy">
Where does the revenue come from?

    - Subscription
    - Transactional
    - Traditional sales
    - Affiliate marketing (profit from referrals)
</Block>





<Block variant="knowledge" title="Pricing strategy">
How are the products priced?

    - Versioning - Multiple versions (e.g. professional, student)
    - Bundling - Cheaper at bulk
    - Freemium - Basic free, premium paid
    - Free trial - Limited time test before purchase
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Long tail strategy">

    - Profit from selling many low-volume, unique items rather than few high-volume items
    - Particularly effective in e-commerce where:
        - No physical inventory limitations
        - Items easily discoverable online
        - Helps compete in crowded markets
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Product differentiation">

    - Vertical - By Standards
    - Horizontal - By Tastes
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Porter's Five Forces of Competition">

    1. Rivalry among existing firms (no. of competitors $\uparrow$ $\implies$ competition $\uparrow$)
    2. Threat of new entrants (entry barriers $\uparrow$ $\implies$ competition $\downarrow$)
    3. Bargaining power of suppliers (no. of suppliers $\uparrow$ $\implies$ dependency $\downarrow$)
    4. Bargaining power of buyers (supply $\uparrow$ power of buyers $\uparrow$)
    5. Threat of substitutes (no. of alternatives $\uparrow$ $\implies$ competition $\uparrow$)
