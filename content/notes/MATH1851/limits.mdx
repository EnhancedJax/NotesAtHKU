## Introduction to the concept of limit

<HLayout split={["65%", "30%"]}>
  <div>
    We can conceptualize that the limit of a function $f(x)$ is $L$ as $x$ approaches $c$, given that we can make $f(x)$ _as close to $L$ as we want_ for all $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, from both sides, _without actually letting $x$ be $a$_. We can write this as:
    ```math
    \lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L
    ```
  </div>

</HLayout>

## One-sided limits

There are two sides that $x$ can tend to a number. We can write it as $x\to n^-$ and $x\to n^+$, which represents from the negative (left) / positive (right) side.

## Existence of limits

<Block title="Condition for limit to exist" variant="primary">
  The limit for a function $f(x)$ only exists if and only if:
  ```math
  \lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)
  ```
  WARNING: If the **limit is** $\infty$ it **doesn't exist**.
</Block>

<HLayout split={["65%", "25%"]}>
  <div>
    For this example, when $x\to 0^-, y\to -\infty$.

    Similarly, as $x\to 0^+, y\to +\infty$.

    Hence, we can conclude that the limit for this function as $x\to 0$ doesn't exist.

## Continuity

<Block title="Continuity" variant="primary">
  A function $f(x)$ is _continuous_ at $x=a$ if:
  ```math
  \mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to a} f\left( x \right) = f\left( a \right)
  ```
</Block>

<Block title="Continuity properties" variant="knowledge">
  For $f,g$ continuous at $c$, the following are also continuous at $c$:
  <ol>
    <li>$f \pm g$</li>
    <li>$kf$</li>
    <li>$fg$</li>
    <li>
      $\frac{f}
      {g}$, given that $g(c)\ne 0$
    </li>
  </ol>
</Block>

<Block title="Intermediate value theorem (IVT)" variant="secondary">
  If a function $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, there is a number $c$ in $[a, b]$ where $f(c)$ in $[f(a), f(b)]$.

We use the IVT by first finding $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then apply the rule.

  <BlockSep />
  To prove that there is a root, we can use the IVT by showing there is a **change of sign** between the interval given.

## Computing limits

<Block title="Indeterminate forms" variant="primary">
  Indeterminate forms are forms that cannot be solved by simply substituting the value of $x$ into the function. They are:
  ```math
  \frac{0}{0},\quad\frac{\infty}{\infty},\quad0\cdot\infty,\quad\infty-\infty,\quad\infty^0,\quad1^\infty,\quad\infty^0
  ```
  Note that $\infty + \infty = \infty$. Related: [L'Hopital's rule](#sec:lhr)
</Block>

<Block title="Using the limit laws" variant="secondary">
  For functions $f,g$ and using $\mathop {\lim }\lim_{x \to a}=\bigcirc$ for simpler notation:
  <ol>
    <li>$lim_{x\to a}c=c$</li>
    <li>$\bigcirc(f\pm g)=\bigcirc f\pm \bigcirc g$</li>
    <li>$\bigcirc(k\cdot f)=\bigcirc k\cdot\bigcirc f$</li>
    <li>$\bigcirc(f^n)=(\bigcirc f)^n$</li>
    <li>$\bigcirc(fg)=\bigcirc f\bigcirc g$</li>
    <li>$\bigcirc(\frac{f}{g})=\frac{\bigcirc f}{\bigcirc g},\quad\text{given that }\bigcirc g\ne 0$. _This strict condition prevents indeterminate forms._</li>
  </ol>
  We can use these laws to break a limit into separate limits, and compute that way. Also note that:
  <ol start="7">
    <li>$\bigcirc f(g)=f(\bigcirc g),\quad$given that $f$ is **continuous** at $\bigcirc g$</li>
  </ol>
</Block>

<Block title="Limit of a polynomial" variant="secondary">
  For the limit of a polynomial $p(x)$:
  ```math
  lim_{x\to a}p(x)=p(a)
  ```
  This can be proven easily with the limit laws above.
</Block>

<Block title="Techniques to compute limits" variant="knowledge">
  To solve for limits, we have to get the expression to the right form - a polynomial, for us to substitute our limit value into the function.

To do this, often we have to **factorize** or **rationalize**.

</Block>

<Block title="Limits of composite functions" variant="knowledge">
  For the limit of a composite function $\lim_{x\to a}f(g(x))$, where $f$ is **not** continuous at $g(a)$, we find $b$ as $x\to a,g\to b$, and then find $\lim_{x\to b}f(x)$ at that value.

The following explains some common cases:

{" "}

<ol>
  <li>$x\to a^-, g\to g(a)^-$</li>
  <li>$x\to a^-, -x\to -a^+$</li>
</ol>

For $y=\lim_{x\to a}f(x)^{g(x)}$, we can the logarithm to simplify the function, and determine $\lim_{x\to a}\ln y$ and find $\lim_{x\to a}y=e^{\lim_{x\to a}\ln y}$.

</Block>

<Block title="Limits of square roots" variant="knowledge">
  To solve for limits of square roots, we can multiply by the conjugate to rationalize the function.
  ```math
  \lim_{x\to a}f(x)+\sqrt{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f^2(x)-g(x)}{f(x)-\sqrt{g(x)}}
  ```
</Block>

<Block title="The squeeze / sandwich theorem" variant="secondary">
  Suppose $f(x)\le g(x) \le h(x)$ in the range $[a, b]$, for $c$ in $[a, b]$:
  ```math
  \lim_{x\to c}f \le \lim_{x\to c}g \le \lim_{x\to c}h
  ```
  We will make use of the fact that the limits can be equal to solve for the limit of $g(x)$.
</Block>

<Block title="Squeezing a function" variant="primary">
  When we can't seem to factorize a function, we can try squeezing it between two other functions.
  ```math
  \lim_{x\to 0}x^2\cos\frac{1}{x}
  ```
  We know the limits of the function $\cos \frac{1}{x}$, so we can start from there.
  ```math
  \text{Given that }x\ne 0, -1\le \cos \frac{1}{x} \le 1
  ```
  ```math
  \text{Multiplying }x^2\text{ on both sides},-x^2\le \cos x^2\frac{1}{x} \le x^2
  ```
  ```math
  \text{As }\lim_{x\to 0}\pm x^2=0,\quad\text{we can conclude that }\lim_{x\to 0}x^2\cos\frac{1}{x}=0
  ```
</Block>

## Infinite limits

<Block title="Determining infinite limits" variant="knowledge">
  If $f(x)$ gets (negatively) arbitrarily large when $x$ approaches $a$, we can say:
  ```math
  \lim_{x\to a}f(x)=(-)\infty
  ```
  After we know that the limit _may_ be infinity, we then have to make sure that _the limit is the same from both sides_, so that the limit is actually $\infty$. We can do so by plugging numbers which are approaching the limit from both sides.

  <div>
    <Block title="Infinite limit exists" variant="primary">
      ```math
      \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{6}{x^2}
      ```
      ```math
      \text{Consider both}\ \lim_{x\to 0^-}\frac{6}{x^2},\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{6}{x^2}:
      ```
      ```math
      \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{6}{x^2}=\infty
      ```
    </Block>

    <Block title="Infinite limit doesn't exist" variant="primary">
      ```math
      \lim_{x\to 4}\frac{3}{(4-x)^3}
      ```
      <center>
        Checking both sides, we can conclude that the limit doesn't exist, as:
      </center>
      ```math
      \lim_{x\to 4^+}\frac{3}{(4-x)^3}=-\infty,\quad\lim_{x\to 4^-}\frac{3}{(4-x)^3}=\infty
      ```
    </Block>
  </div>
</HLayout>

## Limits at infinity

<Block title="Infinity operations" variant="secondary">
  Note the following operations:
  <ol>
    <li>$\infty + k=\infty$</li>
    <li>For $k<0,\ k\infty=-\infty$</li>
    <li>$-\infty\times\infty=-\infty$</li>
  </ol>
</Block>

<Block title="Determining limits of infinity" variant="knowledge">
  It is not hard to see that, for rational numbers $n$:
  ```math
  \lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{k}{x^n}=0
  ```
  The easiest way to determine the limit would be to _factorize_ the function so that we can use the fact above.
</Block>

<Block title="Determining limits of infinity of polynomials" variant="secondary">
  Using the above fact, we can see that for a polynomial $p(x)$ with degree $n$ and largest coefficient $a_n$:
  ```math
  \lim_{x\to\pm\infty}p(x)=a_nx^n
  ```
  Which means we can _only consider the largest term in a polynomial_ for limits of infinity.
</Block>

<Block title="Indeterminate forms by substitution of infinity" variant="primary">
  Substituting $\infty$ into the function gives $\infty-\infty-\infty$, which is indeterminate. Hence, we must factorize it.
  ```math
  \begin{align*}
      \lim_{x\to\infty}2x^4-x^2-8x & =\lim_{x\to\infty}[x^4(2-\frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{8}{x^3})] \\
                                   & =\infty\times 2                                        \\
                                   & =\infty
  \end{align*}
  ```
  Or we can just simply use the theorem above and consider $\lim_{x\to\infty}2x^4$ only to give $\infty$.
</Block>

<Block title="Factor polynomials limit to infinity" variant="primary">
  We can simply consider the largest terms on each side and give the final answer easily.
  ```math
  \begin{align*}
      \lim_{x \to -\infty } \frac{{\sqrt {3{x^2} + 6} }}{{5 - 2x}} & =\lim_{x \to -\infty }\frac{\sqrt{3x^2}}{-2x}                           \\
                                                                   & =\lim_{x \to -\infty }\frac{\sqrt{3}|x|}{-2x} \leftarrow \sqrt{x^2}=|x| \\
                                                                   & =\lim_{x \to -\infty }\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{-2} \leftarrow |c|,c<0=-c        \\
                                                                   & =\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
  \end{align*}
  ```
  Note that, as we are considering the negative limit of infinity, we need to add - to the abs sign on line 3.

## Asymptotes

<Block title="Vertical asymptotes" variant="primary">
  $f$ will have v-asymptotes at $x=a$ if any $\pm$ is true:
  ```math
  \lim_{x\to a^\pm}f(x)=\pm\infty
  ```
</Block>

<Block title="Horizontal asymptotes" variant="primary">
  $f$ will have h-asymptotes at $y=L$ if any $\pm$ is true:

  ```
