## Welcome readers!

Welcome readers! These notes are designed to condense the core concepts for the course MATH1851 at HKU. They are written in a manner that is (hopefully) easy to understand if read chronologically, however, they are not exhausive and do not include extensive examples and applications.

Keep in mind that course contents might change over time. If you spot any errors, feel free to contribue to the notes by submitting a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EnhancedJax/notes.jaxtam.dev), or by leaving a comment below!

Good luck!
