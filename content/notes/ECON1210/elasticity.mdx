## Price elasticity of demand

!!! note "Definition"
    
    The price elasticity of demand $\eta$ is a measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price.

    ```math
    \eta = \frac{\% \Delta Q}{\% \Delta P}
    ```

    - $\eta < -1$: **elastic demand**.
    - $\eta > -1$: **inelastic demand**.
    - $\eta = -1$: **unit elastic demand**.
    - $\eta = 0$: **perfectly inelastic demand**.
    - $\eta = -\infty$: **perfectly elastic demand**.

!!! tip "Formulas"

    **Midpoint formula**    When two points $(Q_0, P_0)$ and $(Q_1, P_1)$ are given:
    ```math
    \eta = \frac{(Q_1-Q_0)(P_0+P_1)}{(Q_0+Q_1)(P_1-P_0)}
    ```

    **Point formula**    When the curve and a point (P, Q) are given, where $Q_x$ is the x-intercept and $P_y$ is the y-intercept:
    
    ```math
    \eta = \frac{P}{Q}\times\frac{1}{\text{Slope}} = -\frac{PQ_x}{QP_y}
    ```
    

!!! info "Linear demand elasticity observations"

    Consider the **mid-point** $M = (Q_m, P_m) = (\frac{Q_x}2, \frac{P_y}2)$ of a linear demand curve:

    - $P > P_m\to\eta < -1$ (elastic).
    - $P < P_m\to\eta > -1$ (inelastic).

    Consider two curves, the **flatter** curve is more elastic **when P is at a common point** of the two curves.

!!! tip "Total revenue"

    **Total revenue** is the product of price and quantity:
    ```math
    PQ \text{ (total revenue)} = P \times Q
    ```
    Therefore, it is also the **area of the rectangle** formed by the price and quantity to the axes.

    Total revenue is **maximized** at the **midpoint** on a linear demand curve.

!!! info "Elasticity, price change and revenue"

    The effects of price change to the revenue $PQ$ is affected by the elasticity of demand:

    | Demand elasticity | $P\uparrow$ | $P\downarrow$ | 
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Elastic | $P\uparrow \times Q\Downarrow = PQ\downarrow$ | $P\downarrow \times Q\Uparrow = PQ\uparrow$ |
    | Inelastic | $P\uparrow \times Q\Uparrow = PQ\uparrow$ | $P\downarrow \times Q\Downarrow = PQ\downarrow$ |

    Where the arrows indicate the direction and magnitude of change. The comparison of magnitude can be visualized by overlaps of the $PQ$ rectangles as well.
