!!! note "Simple monopoly"

    Ability to raise price > marginal cost without losing all customers

    Marginal revenue = marginal cost

    There are multiple sources that can lead to this:
!!! tip "Derivation of Marginal Revenue"

    Quantity: n

    Discrete: MR = TR (n)- TR (n-1)

    Continous: MR curve has twice the slope of D curve. (Coefficienct of $Q\times2$)

!!! info "Simple monopoly pricing"

    1. Find D curve
    2. Obtian MR curve ^^ (discrete vs continous)
    3. Find Profit-maximizing Q* **quantity** @ MR=MC
    4. Price is intersection of D curve and Q=Q*

    More elastic demand -> Lower price, smaller markup
    Less elastic demand -> Higher price, higehr markup

!!! note "Markup"

    ```math
    \text{Markup} = \frac{P - MC}{MC} = \frac{-1}{1+\eta_d} \implies \propto \frac{1}{\eta_d}
    ```

    Where $\eta_d$ is the price elasticity of demand.

!!! tip "Inefficiency"

    Q* < Qe -> DWL is the efficiency loss

    CS top part, PS bottom part including rectangle

    Price $P*$ Intersect(q=q*, D) is the price that monopoly charges. (Monopoly pricing)

    Revenue is $P*\times Q*$

    Total marginal cost (TVC) is the trapesium under left triangle and Q=Q*. 

    Producer surplus = Profit if no fixed cost (Profit=TR-TVC-FC=PS-FC) (PS=TR-TVC)

!!! info "Price control on monopoly"

    Price ceiling: New MR will be line from intersection of D and ceiling to yaxis and xaxis. Marginal revenue is constant for q < x(intersection).

    x(intersection) is maximum quantity that the market sells.

    Price ceiling @ D=MC -> Socially efficient quantity, profit maximizing, no dwl
    Price ceiling @ D=AC -> Zero profit, DWL triangle under x(intersection) and above MC. (Zero profit)
