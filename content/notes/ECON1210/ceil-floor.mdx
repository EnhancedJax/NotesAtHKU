title: Price ceilings and floors
---

Policy makers often intervene in markets to achieve a desired outcome. Two common forms of intervention are price ceilings and price floors.

## Price ceilings


!!! tip "Price ceilings"

    ```math
    P=p
    ```
    
    Limited price that a good can be sold. A price ceiling is **ineffective** if set above $P_eq$. The following are the effects of a price ceiling:

    1. Shortage
    2. Reduction of Product Quality ($S\uparrow$ because lowered COGS, $D\downarrow$ because of lower quality)
    3. Bribery and Wasteful Lines
    4. Loss of Gains from Trade (DWL)
    5. Misallocation of Resources

    ```math
    \begin{aligned}
    Q_1 &= \text{Intersect}(P=p, D)\\
    Q_2 &= \text{Intersect}(P=p, S)\\
    \text{Shortage} &= Q_2 - Q_1\\
    \end{aligned}
    ```

!!! info "Allocation of limited supply"

    There are three ways to allocate the limited supply:
    1. Bibery
    2. Waiting in line
    3. Highest valued customers
    The three ways affect the **welfare loss** and **customer surplus** differently.

    ```math
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Bribe equilibrium} BEq &= y(\text{Intersect}(x = x(Q_1), D)) - p\\
    \text{Let} V &= BEq \times Q_1\\
    \text{Total value of bribery} & = V \text{when allocating by bribery}\\
    \text{Welfare loss} &= \begin{cases}
    DWL & \text{bribery or highest-valued}\\
    DWL + V & \text{waiting in line}
    \end{cases}\\
    \text{Customer surplus} &= \begin{cases}
    CS + V & \text{highest-valued}\\
    CS & \text{bribery or waiting in line}\\
    \end{cases}
    \end{aligned}
    ```
