## Advantages

!!! info "Absolute advantage"

    The cost required for production for any given good is lower than that of another producer.

!!! tip "Comparative advantage"

    A producer has a comparative advantage in producing a good if the **opportunity cost** of producing that good is **lower** than that of another producer.

    The opportunity cost comparatively *of producing a good* is given by:

    ```math
    C : C_a\\
    \text{Cost of producing good} : \max\{\text{Cost of producing an alternative good}\}\\
    ```
    ```math
    U : U_a\\
    \max\{\text{Units producable of alternative good}\} : \text{Units producable of good}
    ```

    We can produce vastly more if we each specialize in what we are best at and trade with each other.

    !!! eg "Unit requirements table"

        | Producer | Good 1 | Good 2 |
        |----------|--------|--------|
        | A        | 3      | 4      |
        | B        | 2      | 1      |

        ```math
        OC_{A,1} = \frac34 = 0.75\\
        OC_{B,1} = \frac21 = 2\\
        OC_{A,1} < OC_{B,1} \implies A \text{ has comparative advantage in producing Good 1}\\
        \therefore \text{A should produce Good 1 and B should produce Good 2}
        ```

!!! tip "Terms of trade (TOT)"

    The ratio at which one good can be exchanged for another, which determines the gains of each producer.

    ```math
    TOT = n\ (\text{Good}_1 : \text{Good}_2)
    ```

    ```math
    \begin{align*}
        \text{Gain from trade for producer of 1} &= C_1 - TOT^{-1} \cdot C_2\\
        
        \text{Gain from trade for producer of 2} &= C_2 - TOT \cdot C_1\\

        \text{Best TOT for producer of 1} &\Rightarrow C_2 - TOT \cdot C_1 = 0\\

        \text{Best TOT for producer of 2} &\Rightarrow C_1 - TOT^{-1} \cdot C_2 = 0
    \end{align*}
    ```

    The admissible $TOT$ is the range of values that trade will occur in, which should be the range of values between the best TOT of producers.

## Production possibilities

!!! tip "Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) - Individual"

    A plot of $G_1-G_2$ where $G_1$ is the quantity of Good 1 produced and $G_2$ is the quantity of Good 2 produced for a single producer.

    Any points **inside** the curve are **inefficient** and any points **outside** the curve are **unattainable**. Points on the curve are **efficient**.

    A PPC can be represented as:
    ```math
    G_1 = (-OC_2) \cdot G_2 + c
    ```

    Where $OC_2$ (slope) is the opportunity cost of producing Good 2 and $c$ (y-intercept) the quantity of Good 1 produced when no Good 2 is produced.

    <BlockSep />

    Use the $PPC$ formula to find the amount of goods produced given amount of the other good by substitution.

    To find the amount of goods produced, given a proportion constraint $p=G_1:G_2$, plot $G_1 = p\cdot G_2$ and find the intersection with the PPC.

!!! tip "PPC of many producers"

    To construct the PPC of multiple producers, we **arrange the curves from lowest to highest opportunity cost (slope)** and connect each ends.

    The curve will be **concave** due to the **increasing opportunity cost** of producing more of a good.

    For the economy, the admissible $TOT \in \{\min\{OC\},\max\{OC\}\}$

!!! note "Economic growth"

    Economic growth is represented by an **outward shift** of the PPC.

    Some factors that can cause this are:
    1. Increase in productive resources (e.g. labour, capital)
    2. Improvement in technology & education

## World trade


!!! tip "Consumption Possibilities Curve (CPC)"

    In a closed economy, $CPC = PPC$ as the economy can only consume what it produces.

    In an open economy, $CPC > PPC$ as the economy can consume what it produces and what it imports.

    Given a world economy of \$p_1 G_1 and \$p_2 G_2, find the CPC by:
    1. Find income by iterating through intersection points of PPCs and axes. Income is given by $I_i = p_1 G_{1i} + p_2 G_{2i}$
    2. Choose highest income $I$
    3. $CPC : G_1 = -\frac{p_2}{p_1} \cdot G_2 + I$

    <BlockSep />

    Use the $CPC$ formula to find the amount of goods consumed given amount of the other good by substitution in an open economy.
