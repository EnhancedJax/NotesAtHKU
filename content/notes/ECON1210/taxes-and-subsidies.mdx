!!! info "Per unit tax and subsidies"

    A per unit tax \$t is a tax of \$t per unit of output. A per unit subsidy \$s is a subsidy of \$s per unit of output. Consider the quantity $ts=s-t$.

    The demand curve will be shifted vertically by $ts$ units, and the supply curve will be shifted vertically by $-ts$ units.

!!! tip "Wedge approach"

    Consider the new equilibrium point $(Q^*, P^*)$. Let the **wedge** be $x=Q^*$. The higher intersection of the wedge is $P_D$, and the lower intersection is $P_S$. 

    ```math
    |ts| = P_D - P_S
    ```

    The per unit share of tax burden / subsidy benefit can be found by $P_D-P^*$ and $P^*-P_S$. 
    
    The cost of tax / subsidy is $|ts| Q^*$. Inside the rectangle, the upper portion is the **consumer burden / benefit** (CB), and the lower portion is the **producer burden / benefit** (PB).

    The **less price elastic side** of the market bears more burden of the tax / subsidy.

!!! tip "Deadweight loss / gain"

    The **lost economic surplus** when the *socially optimal quantity* of a good is not produced, given by:

    ```math
    DWL = \frac{1}{2} \times ts \times (Q^* - Q_e) \propto \eta
    ```

    Where $Q_e$ is the equilibrium quantity without tax / subsidy, and $\eta$ is the elasticity of demand or supply.
