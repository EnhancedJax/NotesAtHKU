title: Recursion
---

Solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem. If you can solve a smaller instance of the problem, you can solve a larger one.


    1. **Base Case(s)**: The simplest instance(s) of the problem that can be solved directly without further recursion.
    2. **Recursive Case(s)**: More complex instances of the problem that are solved by breaking them down and making recursive calls.


<Block variant="knowledge" title="Tower of Hanoi">
**Goal:**Move $n$ disks from peg $A \implies C$ using peg $B$.

**Rules:**Only one disk can be moved at a time, and a disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.

We define the problem as $H(num, from, to, via)$:

    1. Move top $n-1$ disks $A \implies B$ via $C$: $H(n-1, A, B, C)$
    2. Move 1 disk $A \to C$
    3. Move top $n-1$ disks $B \implies C$ via $A$: $H(n-1, B, C, A)$

## Recurrence relation



<Block variant="primary" title="Recurrence relation / equation">
A mathematical equation which is defined in terms of itself.
```math
f(n)=\begin{cases}\quad1&n=1\\2f(n-1)+1&n>1\end{cases}
```

<Block variant="secondary" title="Solve a recurrence relation - subsitution method">
We "solve" a recurrence relation by finding a closed-form expression for $f(n)$ in terms of $n$.

    1. Expand the relation as $f(n)$ to 3 levels
    2. Observe the pattern of $f(n)$
    3. Generalize the pattern in terms of the level $k$
    4. Using the base case to define $k$ in terms of $n$
    5. Subsitute $k$ back into the generalization

    1. Geometric series: $S_n = a(1 + r + r^2 + \cdots + r^{n-1}) = a\frac{r^n - 1}{r-1}$
    2. Arithmetic series: $S_n = n(\frac{a_1+a_n}{2}),\quad n=\text{number of terms}, a=\text{first / last term}$
    3. Factorial: $n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 1$
    4. Falling factorial: $n^{__k__} = n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1)=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
    5. Logarithm: $a^k=b\implies k=\log_a b$
    6. Logarithm property: $k^{\log a} = a^{\log k}$

<Block variant="secondary" title="The master theorem">
The master theorem can give us the order of growth (Big Theta) of a recurrence relation.

For $T(n) = a\cdot T(\frac{n}{b}) + f(n),\quad T(1) = c,\quad a, c > 0,\ b > 1,\ f(n)\in \Theta(n^k),\ d\geq 0$, we have:
$T(n) = \begin{cases}
\Theta(n^{\log_b a}) & \text{if } a > b^k \\
\Theta(n^k \log n)   & \text{if } a = b^k \\
\Theta(n^k)          & \text{if } a < b^k
\end{cases}$

## Mathematical induction



<Block variant="primary" title="Mathematical induction">
A method of mathematical proof that proves a statement for all natural numbers.

    1. **Base case**: Prove the statement for the first natural number in the statement's range.
    2. **Inductive step**: Assume the statement is true for $n$, then prove it is also true for $n+1$.
