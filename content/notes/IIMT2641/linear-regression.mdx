!!! tip "Simple regression model"

    The population model of y with one **predictor** variable x is given by:

    ```math
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
    ```

    where:
    - $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept
    - $\beta_1$ is the slope

    we can express the model as a regression function:

    ```math
    E[y|x] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
    ```

    where $E[y|x]$ is the expected value of y given x. From the *straight-line* formula, $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept and $\beta_1$ is the slope of the line.

!!! tip "Estimated regression function"

    Estimates the regression model with n observations (x_i, y_i)

    ```math
    \hat{y} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} x
    ```

    where:
    - $\hat{\beta_0}$ is the estimated y-intercept
    - $\hat{\beta_1}$ is the estimated slope

!!! info "Residuals"

    The difference between the observed value of the dependent variable and the predicted value.

    ```math
    e_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}
    ```

!!! note "Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)"

    ```math
    SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
    ```

!!! note "Total Sum of Squares (SST)"

    ```math
    SST = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y_i} - \bar{y})^2
    ```

    where:
    - $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the dependent variable

!!! tip "Coefficient of Determination"

    The coefficient of determination, $R^2$, is a measure of how well the model fits the data.

    ```math
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST}
    ```

    where:
    - SSR is the sum of squared residuals
    - SST is the total sum of squares
