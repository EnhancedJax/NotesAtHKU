title: Decision Analysis

**Analytics** is the science of building models that help us make better decisions.

- **Descriptive** amaytics: identify patterns in data.
- **Predictive** analytics: forecast future trends.

## Decision making

Six Steps in Decision Making
- Clearly define the problem (Goal to achieve)
- List the possible alternatives
- Identify the possible outcomes or states of nature
- List the payoff of each alternative in each state of nature
- Select one of the decision theory models
- Apply the model and make your decision

!!! note "Types of decision making environments"
    
    Decisions can be made under different conditions:

    - **Certainty**: all information is known.
    - **Risk**: probabilities of outcomes are known.
    - **Uncertainty**: probabilities of outcomes are not known.

## Decision making under risk

Consider the following example:

| State of Nature | Favorable Market (Profit in $) | Unfavorable Market (Profit in $) | EMV ($) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Construct a large plant | 200,000 | -180,000 | -9,000 |
| Construct a small plant | 100,000 | -20,000 | 34,000 |
| Do nothing | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Probability | 0.45 | 0.55 | |

| Metric | Shorthand | Formula |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Expected Monetary Value | EMV | $\sum\text{Payoff}\times\text{Probability}$ |
| Expected Value with Perfect Information | EVwPI | $\sum\text{Best Payoff}\times\text{Probability}$ |
| Expected Value of Perfect Information | EVPI | $EVwPI - \max\{EMV\}$ |

We want to maximize the $EMV$ under risk. Hence we choose "Construct a small plant".

Given the opportunity, to decide if we should pay a price for additional information, we have to evaulate $P \leq EVPI$. 

Given the price of $P = 65,000$:
```math
\begin{align*}
    EVwPI = 0.45 \times 200,000 &= 90,000\\
    EVPI = 90,000 - 34,000 &= 56,000\\
    P &\gt EVPI
\end{align*}
```

Therefore, we should not pay for additional information.
