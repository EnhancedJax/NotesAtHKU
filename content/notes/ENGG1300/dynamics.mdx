## Newton's laws


<Block variant="primary" title="Newton's first law">
An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force.
</Block>



<Block variant="primary" title="Newton's second law">
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it, and inversely proportional to its mass.
$\sum F=ma$
</Block>



<Block variant="primary" title="Newton's third law">
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This gives rises to forces like friction, normal and tension forces.
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Friction">
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object. It is given by:
$F_f=\mu N$
Where $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction and $N$ is the normal force experienced by the object.
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Conservative force">
Conservative forces are forces that do not depend on the path taken by an object. They also have no lost in energy. They include:

    1. Gravitational force
    2. Elastic force
    3. Electric force
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Inertia force">
Inertia force is the preceived force from the perspective of an accelerating object.
<BlockSep />
For a person in an elevator accelerating upwards at $a$, the inertia force is $ma$ downwards.
</Block>



## Motion


<Block variant="secondary" title="Motion equations">
The following are the equations of motion:

    - **Average velocity: **$v=\frac{ds_t}{dt}$
    - **Average acceleration: **$a=\frac{dv_t}{dt}$
    - $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$
    - $v=u+at$
    - $v^2=u^2+2as$
    - $s=\frac{(v+u)t}{2}$
Where $v$ is the final velocity, $u$ is the initial velocity, $a$ is the acceleration, $t$ is the time, and $s$ is the displacement.
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Circular  motion">
The following are the equations of motion for circular motion:

    - $\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}=\frac{2\pi r}{t} = \frac{v_t}{r}$
    - $v_t = r\omega$
    - $a_c = r\omega^2 = \frac{v_t^2}{r}$
    - $a_t = r a_c$
    - $F_c = \frac{mv_t^2}{r} = ma_c$
    - **Total acceleration: **$a_{to} = \sqrt{a_t^2+a_c^2}$
    - **Accelerating cylinder/disk: **$F = \frac12mra,\ Fr=Ia_c$
$I_{disk}=\frac12mr^2$
<BlockSep />
$\omega$ is the angular velocity, which describes change in angle over time\\
$\{v_t,\ a_t\}$ is the tangential velocity and acceleration, which is tangential to any point on the radius\\
$\{a_c,\ F_c\}$ is the centripetal acceleration and force, which are perpendicular to tangential quantities. They act on the object, hence they be seen as normal forces.\\
$a_{to}$ is the total acceleration, which is the resultant of $a_t$ and $a_c$
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Direction of angular velocity">
The direction of the angular velocity is given by the right-hand rule. If the fingers of the right hand curl in the direction of rotation, the thumb points in the direction of the angular velocity.
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Instantaneous center of zero velocity">
The instantaneous center of zero velocity is the point on a rotating object that has zero velocity. The velocity is perpendicular to the radius (edge) at that point.
![](././img/ic.png)
The velocity at any point is given by:
$v=\omega d$
Where $d$ is the distance from the IC.
</Block>



## Momentum and impulse



<Block variant="primary" title="Momentum and conservation of momentum">
Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity. It is a vector quantity.
$p=mv$
The principle of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a system remains constant if no external forces act on it.
$F_{ext}=0\ ?\ p=\text{const}$
The angular momentum about a point $O$ is given by:
$H_O=Iw=mv_i\times r$
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Coefficient of restitution">
The coefficient of restitution is a measure of how much kinetic energy is conserved in a collision. It is given by:
$e=|\frac{v_{2}-v_{1}}{u_{1}-u_{2}}|$
Where $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are the final velocities, and $u_{1}$ and $u_{2}$ are the initial velocities.

    - $e=1$ is a perfectly elastic collision
    - $e=0$ is a perfectly inelastic collision
    - $0<e<1$ is a (partially) elastic collision
</Block>



<Block variant="primary" title="Impulse (impact)">
Impulse is the change in momentum of an object. It is given by:
$\Delta p=F\Delta t$
</Block>



## Vibrations



### Simple harmonic motion


<Block variant="secondary" title="Simple Harmonic Motion equations">
The following are the equations of motion for simple harmonic motion:

    - $x=A\sin(wt+\phi)$
    - $f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{w}{2\pi}$
    - $T_{vertical} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$
    - $T_{swing} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$
Where $A$ is the amplitude. $\phi$ represents the angle of which the motion starts. ($\Delta\phi$ for $x$ from $x=0$ to $x:t=0$ )
</Block>



<Block variant="primary" title="Natural frequency">
The natural frequency of a spring mass system is the frequency at which the system oscillates when displaced from equilibrium.
$w_0=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$
Where $f$ is the frequency, $k$ is the spring constant, and $m$ is the mass.
</Block>



### Spring mass system



<Block variant="primary" title="Hooke's law">
Hooke's law states that the force required to extend or compress a spring is directly proportional to the extension or compression.
$F=-kx$
Where $F$ is the force, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the extension or compression.
</Block>



<Block variant="primary" title="Damping & damping coefficient">
Damping is the process of reducing the amplitude of an oscillation. It is given by:
$F_d=-cv$
Where $F_d$ is the damping force, $c$ is the **damping coefficient**, and $v$ is the velocity.
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Critical damping">
Critical damping is the minimum amount of damping required to prevent oscillation. It is given by:
$c_{crit}=2\sqrt{mk}$
The following gives the cases of damping:

    - **Underdamping: **$c<c_{crit}$
    - **Overdamping: **$c>c_{crit}$
    - **Critical damping: **$c=c_{crit}$
Critical damping gives the fastest return to equilibrium.
</Block>



## Energy, work and power



<Block variant="primary" title="Work">
Work done is the energy required to move an object. It is given by:
$W=Fd$
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Energy">
The following are the types of energy:

    - **Kinetic: **$E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
    - **Gravitational potential: **$E_{GP}=mgh$
    - **Elastic potential: **$E_{EP}=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$
    - **Friction: ** $E_{f}=F_f\times d=\mu Nd$
    - **Rotational: ** $E_{r}=\frac{1}{2}Iw^2=\frac14mv_t^2$
The energy of a spring-mass system is given by:
$E=E_k+E_{EP}$
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Conversation of energy">
The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy of a system remains constant if no external forces act on it.
$F_{ext}=0\ ?\ E=\text{const}$
This means in a system, energy is converted from one form to another. Use this fact to solve for unknowns.
</Block>



<Block variant="primary" title="Power">
Power is the rate at which work is done. It is given by:
$P=\frac{W}{t}$
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Power and acceleration">
The power required to accelerate an object is given by:
$P=Fv$
Where $F$ is the force, and $v$ is the velocity.
