title: Moment of forces
---


<Block variant="primary" title="Definition of moment">
The moment of a force is a measure of its *tendency* to cause a body to rotate about a specific point.

The moment about a point $O$, when $F$ is applied a distance $d$ from the point is:

$M_O=F\times d$

Keep in mind that *positive* moment is *anti-clockwise*.

## Coplanar / 2D moment


<Block variant="knowledge" title="Resultant moments">
The resultant moment is the **sum** of all moments present on the point, given by:

$M_R=\sum M_O$
</Block>


### The moment of a non-linearly attached force

One simple way is to find the *components* of the force, and sum their individual moments together. The following is a simple example:

After finding the component forces of $F$, we can deduce the resultant moment to be:
```math
\begin{aligned}
M_O &= F_x\times 0.8\sin 45\deg+F_y\times(1+0.8\cos 45\deg) \\
& =-150.7kNm
\end{aligned}
```


## Non-coplanar / 3D moment


<Block variant="primary" title="Moments in a 3D system">
Consider position vector $\vec{r}$ drawn from $O$ to **any point on the *line of action*** of $F$. The moment can hence be given by:

$M_O=r\times F$
</Block>


<Block variant="primary" title="Finding the moment via cross products Cartesian vectors">
The cross product $C$ given by $A$ and $B$ is:

The cross-product for vectors going in the *same direction* is 0. (i.e. $n\boldsymbol{k}\times m\boldsymbol{k}=0$)
</Block>


<Block variant="knowledge" title="Resultant moments">
The resultant moment is simply the **sum** of *couple moments* and moments of forces:

$(M_R)_O=\sum M_O + \sum M$

You can interpret $(M_R)_O$ as the resultant moment about point $O$.

<Block variant="knowledge" title="Finding moments by force perpendicular to plane">
(Exam question) Given a force $F$ acting perpendicular to a plane $ABO$ at $O$, determine the moment about a point $A$.

    1. Find the *position vector* $\{r=OD\}$ of the force. ($AC\times BC=OD$)
    2. Convert force to Cartesian form. ($F=\|F\|\times\frac{r}{\|r\|}$)
    3. Find the *cross product* of the vector from point to the force. ($M_A=OA\times F$)
</Block>



## Couple moments

<HLayout>
<div>
Couples are *two parallel forces* that have the same magnitude but have *opposite directions*, separated by a *perpendicular distance* $d$. The magnitude of the moment is given by:

$M=Fd$

Notice that there's no point mentioned so far. For couple moment, it is **always the same about any point**. Let's assume for any point $O$ (refer to graph), the moment is:
```math
\begin{aligned}
M_O &= r_B \times F + r_A \times (-F) \\
    &= (r_B - r_A) \times F \\
    &= r \times F \quad \text{which is independent of } O
\end{aligned}
```
Hence, we can say that couple moments are **free vectors**.
