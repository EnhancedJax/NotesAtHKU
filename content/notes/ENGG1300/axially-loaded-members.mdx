title: Axially loaded members
---
Axial loading refers to the application of a force along the axis of the member.

## Stress and strain


<Block variant="primary" title="Axial stress">
Axial stress is the stress that is *parallel* to the cross-sectional area of the member. It is given by:
$\sigma=\frac{F}{A}    (Nm^{-2})$
Where $F$ is the force applied, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the member. Note that $1 Pa = 1 Nm^{-2}$.
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Eccentric loading and stress">
When a force is applied *off-centre* to the member, the stress at each end is given by:
$\sigma=\frac{\sum F}{wd}\pm \frac{6F\times e}{d\times w^2}$
Where $w$ is the width of the member, $d$ is the depth of the member, and $e$ is the eccentric distance from the centroid of the member to the point of application of the force.
The $\pm$ sign is used to denote the *maximum* and *minimum* stress on opposite sides.
</Block>


<Block variant="primary" title="Axial strain">
Axial strain is the ratio of the change in length to the original length of the member. It is given by:
$\epsilon=\frac{\Delta x}{x}    \text{(Ratio)}$
Where $\Delta x$ is the change in length, and $L$ is the original length of the member.
</Block>




## Materials


<Block variant="primary" title="Strength">
Material strength is defined as the **maximum stress** that can be resisted by the material.
</Block>


<Block variant="primary" title="Young's Modulus">
Young's modulus is the ratio of stress to strain, given by:
$E=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}=\frac{Fx}{A\Delta x}    (Pa, Nm^{-2})$
</Block>



<Block variant="primary" title="Poisson's ratio">
Poisson's ratio is the ratio of lateral strain $\epsilon_l$ to axial strain $\epsilon$, given by:
$\nu=-\frac{\epsilon_l}{\epsilon}    (\text{Ratio})$
<BlockSep />

The lateral strain $\epsilon_l$ is $\frac{\Delta d}{d_0}$.

## Hydrostatic pressure



<Block variant="primary" title="Hydrostatic/water pressure">
The water pressure acting on any surface is *always perpendicular* to the surface, and the pressure is given by:
$p=\rho gh    (Pa, Nm^{-2})$
Where $\rho$ is the density of water,  and $h$ is the depth of the water.
Hence, we can see that the water pressure **increases linearly with depth**.
</Block>


<Block variant="secondary" title="Water pressure load on slanted surface">
The load exerted on a slanted surface by water pressure F is given by and located at:
$F=\frac{\rho g d w L}{2}     @ \frac{1}{3}L\ /\ \frac{2}{3}d$
Where $d$ is the depth of water, $w$ is the width of the volume, and $L$ is the length of the surface.
</Block>


<Block variant="primary" title="Internal tensile stress">
Internal tensile stress (hoop stress) refers to the stress caused by the internal force, acting along the *circumferential direction* of a cross section.
$\sigma_{\text{pipe}}=\frac{Pd}{2t},    \sigma_{\text{sphere}}=\frac{Pr}{2t}$
Where $P$ is the internal pressure, and $t$ is the thickness.
