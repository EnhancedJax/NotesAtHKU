During the period, the cycle records all your transactions accordingly by the [Cash Basis of Accounting](#thm-cash_basis). At the end of a period, we test for errors and respect our transactions by the [Accural Method of Accounting](#thm-accrual_basis). Finally, we create finanical statements that will be published, so that stakeholders can make decisions based on the financial information.
