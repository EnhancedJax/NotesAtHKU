The financial statements are the primary means of communication between a company and its stakeholders. It allows them to make informed decisions about providing resources to the entity (e.g. investing, lending).


<Block variant="knowledge" title="Pervasive Cost-Benefit Constraint">
The benefits of providing finanical information should outweigh its costs.

<Block variant="knowledge" title="Formatting">
The following are the <u>required</u> headers and footers for financial statements:

    - Name of the company
    - Title (type of statement)
    - Specific date covered (At December 31, 2025)
    - Unit of measure (In millions of dollars)
    - Bottom: *The notes are an integral part of the financial statements.*
Some conventions for styling:

    - Dollar sign for first and total amounts
    - Line above sub-totals
    - Double underline for totals
    - Brackets for negative numbers
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Classified vs. Unclassified Financial Statements">
A classified financial statement would break accounts into different classes (e.g. current / non-current A&L), whereas an unclassified financial statement would list all accounts in the same class together.

We can build financial statements by referencing your adjusted trial balance.


## Relations between account types


<Block variant="secondary" title="Extended accounting equation">
The following equations are based on the definition of the individual items:

**A**ssets = **L**iabilities + **E**quity

*Retained Earnings* = **R**evenue - **E**xpenses

$\Delta$**E**quity = *Retained Earnings* - **D**ividends

*Retained Earnings* here is the **Net income** generated by the business, and what's left of it.

These relationships & equations are demonstrated in their respective financial statements:

    1. [Balance Sheet](#sec-balance_sheet)
    2. [Income Statement](#sec-income_statement)
    3. [Statement Se](#sec-statement_se)

## Income Statement



Principle: [**RE** = **R** - **E**](#thm-relations)

Reports profit / loss <u>over a period of time</u>. *Income before / after taxes must be displayed separately*



<ACCTExample title="Example Income Statement (Classified by Operating & Non-operating)">
</ACCTExample>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Key items of the Income Statement">

    - Operating R&E $\rightarrow$ Income from operations
    - Other Revenue / Expense $\rightarrow$ Income before taxes
    - Tax Expense $\rightarrow$ Net Income & EPS
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Gross profit">
The difference between **Sales Revenue** and **Cost of Goods Sold**.
</Block>



## Statement of Stockholder's Equity



Principles:


    - [Beginning **CS** + **Stock Issurance** = Ending **CS**](FIXME-def:sale_of_stock)
    - [Beginnging **RE** + **NI** - **D** = Ending **RE**](#thm-relations)


Reports changes in stockholder's equity over a period of time.

## Balance Sheet



Principle: [**A** = **L** + **E**](#thm-relations)

The balance sheet is prepared **after creating the [Closing Entries**](FIXME-sec:closing_entries**).

Reports the financial position of a company at a <u>specific point in time</u>. Helpful for demonstrating the [current ratio](FIXME-def:current_ratio).



<ACCTExample title="**Total Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity**">
</ACCTExample>




It is called a **balance sheet** because the **left side** (assets) is equal to the **right side** (liabilities + equity).


## Cash flow statement



### Cash flows



<Block variant="secondary" title="Identifying types of cash flows activities">
The following is a general way to categorize cash flows:

    - **Financing**: Changes in shares, borrowing money or repayment of long term debt
    - **Investing**: The purchase / sale of long-term assets that sit outside of the businessses' core operations
    - **Operating**: Revenue generating activities of a business
An entry has **no effect** on cash flow if it doesn't involve cash.

The direction of cash flow: cash is **debited** (cash outflow) or **credited** (cash inflow).
</Block>



### Information needed for preparing cash flow statement


    - *Comparative* balance sheets (showing current and previous years)
    - Income statement


### Preparing statement with indirect method


Principle: Calculate cash flows and check with the change in cash balance.

We generally use **indirect** method, which is more convenient to prepare. The only difference between the indirect and direct method is the operating activities section. We're just going to focus on the indirect method.

We can calculate the **cash flow from operating activities by**:
```math
\text{Net Income} + \text{Non-cash expenses + \text{Gain/Loss on sale of non-current A}} - \Delta\text{cA&cL}
```
Which we will do inside the statement. The general steps to prepare the statement are:

    - Calculate change and label type of cash flow (FIO) on the balance sheet, as well as for any additional information
    - Identify the non-cash expenses (depreciation, amortization)
    - Identify if there are any gains or losses on the sale of non-current assets
    - Use the changes in [O] and **reverse their effects** on the cash flow statement\\
(e.g. $\uparrow A \rightarrow -ve,\quad\downarrow L \rightarrow -ve$ )

    - Fill in the rest

Note that we use **payments** and **proceeds** for financing activities to describe cash outflows and inflows, respectively.

## Order of creation


Note the importance of the order of creation of the statements as listed:

    1. Income Statement: Provides the **Net Income** $\downarrow$
    2. Statement of Stockholder's Equity: Provides the **Ending RE** $\downarrow$
    3. Balance Sheet: Provides the **Ending A, L, E** to compare with the previous year $\downarrow$
    4. Statement of Cash Flows:
