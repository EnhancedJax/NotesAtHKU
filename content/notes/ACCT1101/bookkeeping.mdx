Bookkeeping is the process of recording transactions in a systematic way.

*For convenience, in the notes "you" refers to "the company"*


## Identifying transactions





<Block variant="primary" title="Accounts">
An account stores all transactions related to a group of related items.
</Block>




<Block variant="secondary" title="The 6 types of accounts">
There are 6 types of accounts:

    - **A**sset - Stuff you own
    - **L**iability - Stuff you owe 3rd parties
    - **E**quity (Stockholders' Equity) - Stuff for owners
        - **R**evenue - Money you earn from selling stuff
        - **E**xpense - Costs of doing business
        - **D**ividend - Money given to owners
R,E,D all feed into Equity. This will be further explored in [Financial Statements](FIXME-sec:financial_statements).
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Current vs non-current A&L">

    - **Current A&L** - Due within 1 year
    - **Non-current A&L** - Stuff that stays with you for more than 1 year
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Operating vs non-operating R&E">

    - **Operating** - Central focus of business
    - **Non-operating** - Not related to the main business
</Block>





<Block variant="knowledge" title="Contra accounts">
Contra accounts are accounts that have a normal balance **opposite** to the account type. The following is how we present them in a financial statement:
<BlockSep />

| **Assets** |  |

<Block variant="knowledge" title="Cash and cash equivalents">
The most liquid assets that can be **quickly converted to cash**. We usually group these into a single *cash* account.
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Notes Receivable / Payable">
The money you own / owe with an interest rate.
<BlockSep />
*Example 1: * You borrowed \$1000 from a bank. (Payable)
</Block>




<Block variant="knowledge" title="Debts">
The money you borrow from a bank.
</Block>



## Preparing journal entries




<Block variant="primary" title="The accounting equation">
$A = L + E$
This equation is based on the principle that **Stuff that you OWN = Stuff that you OWE**.
</Block>




<Block variant="secondary" title="Double-entry bookkeeping">
From money to go to one account *(source)*, it must come from another *(destination)*. This is the *duality* of every transaction in accounting.
$\uparrow$ **Debit (Dr)** is the term to describe the **destination** of money flow, whereas $\downarrow$ **Credit (Cr)** is the term to describe the **source** of money flow.
</Block>










<Block variant="knowledge" title="Categorizing transactions as Dr / Cr">
We can categorize transactions as debits or credits by their accounts' type:
Dr - Cr
**DEALER**
Dividend, Expense, Asset - Liability, Equity, Revenue
They would be a Dr / Cr if their value was positive. Otherwise, they would be the other way around.
*This is based on rearranging the accounting equation and expanding its terms.*
</Block>



<Block variant="primary" title="Journal entry">
A record of a transaction in the journal __during the accounting period__. The following is the format:

    - Date
    - Account
    - Description
Amounts credited are usually **indented**.
</Block>

## Posting to general ledger











<Block variant="knowledge" title="T-accounts">
T-account is a way to visualize an account. **Dr** goes on the left, **Cr** goes on the right. The closing balance is displayed on the corresponding side.

## Reporting and intepreting Stockholder's Equity



Corporate businesses has an advantage over proprietorships of the ease of participation in ownership. This is done through the issuance of **common stock**. Owners of common stock are known as *stockholders / shareholders*.

**Dividends** are the money paid to the shareholders from the company's profits, when the company decides to distribute them.


### Benefits of stock ownership


Stockholders have the following benefits:


    - Voice in management
    - Dividends
    - Claim of assets upon liquidation of company


### Authorized, issue and outstanding shares


The following are the categorization of stocks:


    - Authorized - Max. number that can be sold
        - Issued - Sold to the public
            - <ColorBox color='pink'>**Common stock**</ColorBox> - Currently held by the public (Outstanding stock)
            - <ColorBox color='pink'>**Treasury stock**</ColorBox> - Bought back by the company from the public
            - [Preferred stock](#def-preferred_stock)
        - Unissued - Never been sold


<Block variant="primary" title="Common stock">
The shares currently held by public.
</Block>



<Block variant="primary" title="Treasury stock">
The shares bought back by the company from the public. This is a [contra](#def-contra)-equity account, as can be thought of as being opposite to common stock.
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Par vs market value">

    - **Par value** - The minimum price of the stock
    - **Market value** - The price of the stock in the market
</Block>
















<Block variant="secondary" title="Preferred stock">
A special category of stocks. They have a *fixed dividend rate* which is *paid before common stockholders*. However, they do not have voting rights.
The preferred stock holders offers two **dividend options**:

    1. **Current** - Paid in the current period, limits to before common stockholders
    2. **Cummulative** - Paid in the future if not paid in the current period. This amount is called **dividends in arrears**.
Preferred stock has a **fixed dividend rate**, which is given by:
$\text{**P**referred **D**ividends} = \text{Par value} \times \text{Dividend rate} \times \text{Number of shares}$
They have a separate par value from common stock.
As their dividends are paid first:
$\text{**C**ommon **D**ividends} = D - PD$
<BlockSep />
"Preferred stock: \$20 par value, 1\% rate, 1000 shares. Common stock: \$10 par value, 5000 shares." $\implies$ PD = $20 \times 1000 \times 0.1 = 2000$
Consider a issurance of \$3000 dividends, for *current* preference:
$\text{PD}=2000$,
$\text{CD} = 3000 - \text{PD} = 1000$
Consider a issurance of \$10000 dividends, for *cummulative* preference, dividends in arrears for 2 years:
$\text{PD} = 2000 + 2000 * 2 = 6000$ (first 2000 is the current year's),
$\text{CD} = 10000 - \text{PD} = 4000$
</Block>




### Reporting stockholder's equity









<Block variant="secondary" title="Sale of stock">
When a stock is sold. Other than recording the stock issurance, we also need to record the <ColorBox color='pink'>**additional paid-in capital**</ColorBox> (APC) when the stock is sold for more than the [par value](#def-par_market).
$\Delta$**C**ommon **S**tock = Stock Issurance = Number of shares $\times$ Par value
$\Delta$**APC** = Value - Stock Issurance
<BlockSep />
"Issued 200m additional shares of \$0.01 par value for \$16m" $\implies\ \Delta$APC = 14m, $\Delta$CS = 2m
*Example entry:*

| Cash | \$16 |  |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Common Stock |  | 2 |
| Additional Paid-in Capital |  | 14 |

</Block>





<Block variant="secondary" title="Declaring dividends">
When we declare a dividend, we **allocate money** to the owners from retained earnings.
<BlockSep />
"Declared dividends of \$2m"
*Example entry:*

| Retained earnings | \$2 |  |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Dividends payable |  | 2 |

</Block>












<Block variant="secondary" title="Repurchase and reissurance of stock">
When we *re*issure stock, we need to credit treasury stock instead of common stock, as we pull from our own stock. We also need to record the [additional paid-in capital](#def-sale_of_stock) when we sell the stock for more than its par value.
<BlockSep />
"Reacquired 10 shares of common stock when selling for \$14 per share." $\implies \Delta$Treasury = 140
*Example entry:*

| Treasury stock | \$140 |  |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Cash |  | 140 |

"Reissued 1 shares of treasury stock at \$13 per share" $\implies \Delta$APC = -1 (less than par value), $\Delta$Treasury = 14
*Example entry:*

| Cash | \$13 |  |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Additional paid-in capital | 1 |  |
| Treasury |  | 14 |

## Reporting inventories & COGS



<Block variant="primary" title="Inventory">
The goods that you have for sale as a retailer, or the raw materials that you have for sale as a manufacturer.
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Supplies vs. Inventory">
Supplies are consumables (such as paper, boxes etc.) for the business.
</Block>


As a retailer, you purchase the goods to sell as inventory from a supplier, and make a sale to a customer. We need to record this purchase, sale, COGS and the change in inventory.


<Block variant="secondary" title="Reporting inventories and COGS (Inventory system)">
There are two ways we can record COGS and inventory in an according period:

    - **As the goods are sold / purchased** (Perpetual)
        - $\checkmark$ Updates accounts in real-time
        - $\times$ More complex, more costly
    - **At the end of the period** (Periodic)
        - $\times$ Does not update accounts in real-time
        - $\checkmark$ Less complex, less costly
</Block>





<ACCTExample title="Example to compare the two inventory systems">
</ACCTExample>



The difference between the COGS and the revenue will reflect the profit accordingly when we produce the [income statement](FIXME-sec:income_statement).

The above example assumes that the <ColorBox color='yellow'>cost of inventory</ColorBox> is the same for each unit on every restock, which is not always the case.


<Block variant="secondary" title="Inventory cost flow table">
Reflects the changes in inventory during an accounting period, with the total cost of good sold depending on [cost flow assumptions](#thm-cost_flow).
</Block>




<ACCTExample title="Example of inventory cost flow table">
</ACCTExample>




<Block variant="secondary" title="Cost flow assumptions">
To determine the COGS when we purchased the goods at different costs, we can use the following assumptions:

    - **FIFO** - First In, First Out
    - **LIFO** - Last In, First Out
    - **AVCO** - Average cost of all units (Total cost / Available units)
    - **Specific Identification** - Ratio / quantity specified
They are assumptions because we do not know which physical units were sold.
<BlockSep />

    1. <ColorBox color='yellow'>?</ColorBox>$\ =1(100)+2(50)=200$
    2. <ColorBox color='yellow'>?</ColorBox>$\ =2(100)+1(50)=250$
    3. <ColorBox color='yellow'>?</ColorBox>$\ =\frac{500}{300}(150)=250$
</Block>





<Block variant="knowledge" title="Which assumption is better?">
We must take into account for the **rise / drop in inventory prices during the period** when considering which assumption is better.
In a period of **rising prices**:

    - FIFO - Higher net income (less COGS expenses)
    - LIFO - Lower net income (more COGS expenses)
*Note: Accounting rules require companies to apply their accounting methods on a consistent basis over time. (Can't change frequently)*
</Block>



### Net realizable value of inventory



<Block variant="primary" title="Net realizable value">
The actual of the inventory that the company can profit from.
$NRV = \text{Selling price} - \text{Cost to sell}$
</Block>







<Block variant="secondary" title="Reporting Inventory at Lower of Cost or Net Realizable Value">
We need to report inventory at its **minimum** of the *cost* or NRV. This is to prevent **overstating** the value of inventory.
If $NRV < Cost$, the company would make a **“write-down” entry** of $(Cost - NRV) \times units$ to reduce the inventory balance to NRV. (As they are originally recorded at cost).
<BlockSep />
*Example: The company has 1000 units of inventory at \$10 each. The NRV is \$8.*
The valuation used at the end of this period would be $1000 \times 8 = 8000$. As $NRV < Cost$, we need to make the following entry:

| **Account** | **Dr** | **Cr** |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| COGS | 2000 |  |
| $    $ Inventory |  | 2000 |

$(10-8)\times1000=2000$
</Block>



## Reporting equipments




<Block variant="primary" title="Acquisition costs">
We include the following **acquisition costs** in the value of an equipment upon acquisition:

    - Purchase price
    - Sales taxes
    - Legal fees
    - Transportation costs
    - Installation and preparation costs
The act of inclusion is also called **capitalization**.
<BlockSep />
*Example: Soutwest Airlines purchased aircraft of \$20, and paid \$1 for transportation and \$2 for installation.*

| **Account** | **Dr** | **Cr** |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Equipment | \$23 |  |
| $    $ Cash |  | \$23 |

</Block>





<Block variant="secondary" title="Reporting maintenance and improvements of equipment">

    - **Maintenance** - Expense
    - **Improvements** - Capitalized
Some identifying characteristics of improvements are *large sums of money*, *longer useful life*, and *increased efficiency*.
</Block>




<Block variant="secondary" title="Reporting asset disposal">

    1. Record **[depreciation** expense](FIXME-subsec:depreciation) of the item for this period
    2. Calculate and write-off **accumulated depreciation** for this item
    3. Record the disposal of the asset by crediting it
    4. Record "gain on sale of assets" (revenue) or "loss on sale of assets" (expense) by balancing the entry
<BlockSep />
*Example: Southwest Airlines sold flight equipment for \$11 cash at the end of its 17th year of use. The flight equipment originally cost \$30 and was depreciated using the straight-line method with zero residual value and a useful life of 25 years.*

|  | **Account** | **Dr** | **Cr** |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | Depreciation expense | \$1.2 |  |
|  | $    $ Accumulated depreciation |  | \$1.2 |
|  | (${30}/{25}=1.2$) |  |  |
| 2. | Cash | \$11 |  |
|  | Accumulated depreciation | 20.4 |  |
|  | $    $ Equipment |  | 30 |
|  | $    $ Gain on sale of assets |  | 1.4 |
|  | ($1.2 \times 17=20.4$) |  |  |

</Block>







<Block variant="knowledge" title="Change in estimates">
If we change the estimates of the useful life or residual value of an asset, we need to **recalculate the net book value** of the asset.
<BlockSep />
*Example: Southwest Airlines spent \$200 improving the flight equipment of \$1000, changing the useful life of the flight equipment from 25 years to 30 years, with 0 residual value. It was in service for 2 years. Find the new net book value and calculate depreciation for this period.*
Computation for change in estimates:

    - Original cost: \$1000
    - Less: Accumulated depreciation: $\frac{1000}{25}\times2=\$80$
    - Improvement capitalized cost: \$200
    - **New cost**: \$1120
Depreciation expense: $\frac{1120}{30-2}=\$40$
</Block>



## Reporting taxes




<Block variant="primary" title="Income tax">
The tax that you pay on your income. It is calculated as a percentage of your income. We usually record it as **tax payable** until we actually pay the tax.
<BlockSep />
*Example: Southwest Airlines has a tax rate of 30\%. They earned \$1000 in revenue. Record the tax expense.*

| **Account** | **Dr** | **Cr** |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Income tax expense | \$300 |  |
| $    $ Income tax payable |  | \$300 |
