## Component percentages



Instead of using monetary amounts, we use **percentages** to compare the values to a **single base amount**. We divide all amounts on the statement by the base amount.

We choose the base amount based on the statement:

    - *Income statement* $\rightarrow$ **Net sales**
    - *Balance sheet* $\rightarrow$ **Net assets**

## Ratio analysis



    - **Ratios** are used to evaluate the financial performance of a company.
    - They are used to compare the company's performance to:
        - **Industry averages**
        - **Historical data**
Without these benchmark values, no insights can be made.

    - We can only compare ratios for two firms if they are **comparable** in terms of *industry, operations and accounting policies*.
    - A company's **accounting policies** influences its ratios.
