<Block variant="primary" title="Trial balance">
An accounting report showing the closing balances of all general ledger accounts.
Their purpose is to ensure that the __debits and credits are equal__ - to check for errors and help prepare financial statements.

## Posting adjusting entries





<Block variant="secondary" title="Adjusting our Trial Balance">
In the account cycle, after preparing an unadjusted trial balance, we make adjustments to respect the [Accrual Basis of Accounting](FIXME-thm:accrual_basis) for different types of expense and revenues.
This adjustment is necessary when the two sides of a transaction (remember [double-sided nature](FIXME-thm:debit_credit)) happens in a __different accounting period__. (So no adjustments necessary if same period)
</Block>






<Block variant="secondary" title="A typical transaction">
In a transaction there are two parties: a buyer and a seller.
Seller $\xrightleftharpoons[\text{cash}]\{\text{services}\}$ Buyer
In the case of the **buyer**, the transaction will always be an **expense**.
In the case of the **seller**, the transaction will always be **revenue**.
</Block>




<Block variant="primary" title="Categorizing E&R as prepayments / accruals">
We need to categorize E&R as either **Prepayments** or **Accruals** before making an adjusting entry as part of the analysis.

    - **Prepayments**: services paid for before received (by buyer), also called **Deferrals**
    - **Accrued**: services received before paid for (by buyer)
</Block>


Hence, there will be *4 titles* for the adjusting entries as follows, along with examples:

    - **Deferred Expense** (A, Dr)\\
*Example*: As a buyer, you drive a car. Your car warranty is for a year, but you pay for it the year prior. The service (car warranty) is paid for before received, hence, this is a prepaid expense.



    - **Deferred Revenue** (L, Cr)\\
*Example*: As a seller, you sell car warranty. The service (car warranty) is paid for by the customer before it becomes active in the next year, hence, this is a deferred (prepaid) revenue.



    - **Accrued Expense** (L, Cr)\\
*Example*: As a buyer, you consume water. Water bills are paid every 3 months, but you use water every month and your accounting period is a month. The service (water) is received before paying for by the customer, hence, this is an accrued expense.



    - **Accrued Revenue** (A, Dr)\\
*Example*: As a seller, you provide water. The service (water) is provided before paying for by the customer, hence, this is an accrued revenue.






<Block variant="secondary" title="What the adjusting entry does">
As we recorded our transaction on the cash basis initially, it **overstates** the corresponding E/R. The purpose of the adjusting entry is to **correct this overstatement** by converting the transaction to either **A/L**. This conversion moves the transaction to the [**permanent accounts**](FIXME-def:temp_perm), which carries forward to the next period for adjustment again.
To determine if the overstated transaction is A/L:

    - **Asset (Dr)**: Future economic benefit
    - **Liability (Cr)**: Future economic sacrifice
</Block>




<Block variant="secondary" title="Releasing prepayments and accruals">
As we record by the accrual basis, when we consume the / a part of the service, or the payment is made, we need to record the transaction accordingly. If only a part of the service is consumed, __calculate the consumed amount by time period__.
This moves the transaction back to the [**temporary accounts**](FIXME-def:temp_perm).

## Depreciation




### Recording as adjusting entry



<Block variant="primary" title="Depreciation">
The process of reducing the book value of a tangible fixed asset over time.
</Block>











<Block variant="knowledge" title="Recording depreciation expense">

| **Date** | **Account** | **Dr** | **Cr** |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- |
| Dec 31, 2023 | Depreciation expense | \$12 |  |
|  | Accumulated depreciation |  | \$12 |

Accumulated depreciation is a [**contra asset**](FIXME-def:contra), as it has a normal balance opposite to the asset. We record it like the following in the balance sheet:

| **Assets** |  |
| :--- | ---: |
| Equipment | \$100 |
| Accumulated depreciation | (12) |
| **Total** | \$88 $\leftarrow$ **Book value** |

Depreciation expense is an **operating expense**, as the depreciation occurs in the course of the business operations.
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Depreciation expense">
The expense that is recorded **each period** over the useful life of the asset.
</Block>



### Calculating depreciation expense


Before calculation, you need to identify *some* of the following quantities:

    - **(C) Cost**: The initial cost of the asset.
    - **(RV) Residual value**: The estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life.
    - **(UL) Useful life**: The estimated number of years the asset will be used.
    - **(P$_T$) Total production**: The total number of units the asset will produce over its useful life.
    - **(P$_A$) Annual production**: The number of units the asset will produce in a year.
    - **(AD) Accumulated depreciation**: The total depreciation expense recorded for the asset up to the current period.



<Block variant="secondary" title="Depreciation estimation methods">

| *Method* | *Formula* | *Per period* |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Straight-line | $\frac{C - RV}{UL}$ | Constant amount each period. |
| Units-of-production | $(C - RV)\times\frac{P_A}{P_T}$ | Based on production level. |
| Double-declining balance | $2\times\frac{C-AD}{UL}$ | Decreasing amount each period. |

For the final year of double-declining balance, the depreciation must set the book value to residual value. Hence, the formula is $(C-RV)- AD$.

## Amortization



<Block variant="primary" title="Definite and indefinite life of intangible assets">
When an intangible asset is aquired, managers will decide if they have a **definite** or **indefinite** life.

    - **Definite life**: Cost is amortized over it's useful life across account periods.
    - **Indefinite life**: Cost is not amortized, but tested for impairment annually.
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Amortization expense">
The value is usually calculated by the **straight-line method**, similar to depreciation but without $RV$:
$\text{Amortization expense} = \frac{\text{C}}{\text{UL}}$
</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Impairment and impairment loss">
Impairment is the reduction of an asset's value.
$\text{Impairment loss} = \text{Carrying value} - \text{Fair value}$
</Block>




## Sales revenue & Bad debt expenses



### Net sales revenue


When considering the net sales revenue, we need to recognize some of the following deductions. They are not expenses, but a [**contra revenue**](FIXME-def:contra) of **credit sales revenue**.

The following are three common contra accounts of sales revenue. When they occur, we **debit** the contra revenue account and **credit** sales revenue.

These discounts **should not include** the [capitalized](FIXME-subsec:equipments) costs.


<Block variant="secondary" title="Credit card discount">
When paying with a credit card, the merchant will be charged a fee by the credit card company. This fee is typically a percentage of the transaction amount.
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Sales discounts">
Discounts given to customers for early payment, called a **early repayment incentive**. For the following terms:
$2/10, n/30 \implies \text{2\% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise net due in 30 days}$
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Sales returns and allowances">
Discounts given to customers for price discounts, or the total sales price of the returned goods.
</Block>




<Block variant="knowledge" title="Presenting in income statement">
We simply present as a [**contra revenue**](FIXME-def:contra) of **sales revenue**.

| **Sales revenue** | \$1000 |
| :--- | ---: |
| Sales returns and allowances | (100) |
| Sales discounts | (50) |
| Credit card discount | __(20)__ |
| **Net sales revenue** | \$830 |

</Block>



### Bad debts


To keep track of each customer's account receivables, we usually assign an individual account for each customer (a **subsidiary account**).

**Bad debts** result from credit customers who will not pay the amount they owe (accounts receivable), regardless of collection efforts. For example, a customer who is bankrupt.


<Block variant="primary" title="Account: Bad debt expense">
An expense account for the amount of money that is not likely to be paid. There are two methods to do so:
</Block>




### Accounting bad debt expenses



<Block variant="primary" title="Account: Allowance for doubtful accounts">
An [**contra account**](FIXME-def:contra) for the **accounts receivable** to estimate the amount of money that will not be paid.
</Block>



<Block variant="secondary" title="Credit sales">
Credit sales are *sales revenue* that **debit accounts receivable** (credit sales is not an account).
</Block>











<Block variant="knowledge" title="Write-offs & estimating bad debt expense">
We record an [**estimated**](FIXME-thm:bad_debt_est) bad debt expense at the end of the period of the credit sales as an adjusting entry.
During the next period, we **write-off** the bad debt expense of the previous period, when we have **confirmed** that the customer will not pay, by deducting from **accounts receivable** to **allowance for doubtful accounts**.
*A write-off has no effects on the **net income**, as it is already recorded as an expense in the previous period.*

    - End of period of sales: Allowance (**Cr**) $\rightarrow$ Bad debt expense (**Dr**)
    - Next period write-offs (confirmed bad debts): Accounts receivable (**Cr**) $\rightarrow$ Allowance (**Dr**)
</Block>






<Block variant="knowledge" title="Recoveries">
When a customer who has a bad debt previously pays, we simply revert the write-off entry:

| **Date** | **Account** | **Dr** | **Cr** |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- |
| Dec 31, 2023 | Cash | \$12 |  |
|  | Allowance for doubtful accounts |  | \$12 |

</Block>



### Estimating bad debt expenses



<Block variant="secondary" title="Estimate bad debt by Percentage of sales">
Bad debt expense adjustment = **Credit** sales revenue (minus returns and allowances) $\times$ *Historial* loss rate
</Block>




<Block variant="secondary" title="Estimate bad debt by Aging method">
We estimate the **ending balance** of the allowance by the age of receivables, and calculate the adjustment by finding the **difference** between the allowance's **current balance** (beg. bal. of allowance - write-offs) and the ending balance.

| **Age of receivable** | **Amount** | **Estimated loss rate** | **Estimated loss** |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 0-30 days | \$1000 | 1\% | \$10 |
| 31-60 days | \$2000 | 2\% | \$40 |
| 61-90 days | \$1500 | 3\% | __\$45__ |
| **Estimated ending bal. of allowances** |  |  | \$95 |
| Balance of allowance |  |  | (\$5) |
| **Bad debt expense adjustment** |  |  | \$90 |

</Block>



<Block variant="knowledge" title="Estimate bad debt by Percentage of receivables">
Estimated ending balance of allowance $=$ Accounts receivables balance $\times$ rate of loss
</Block>




<Block variant="knowledge" title="Presenting in income statement">
We present the allowance of doubtful accounts as a [**contra asset**](FIXME-def:contra) of **accounts receivable**.

| **Accounts receivable** | \$1000 |
| :--- | ---: |
| Allowance for doubtful accounts | (10) |
| **Net realizable value** | \$990 |
