<Block variant="primary" title="Closing entries">
Entry to reset temporary accounts to zero by transferring their balances to **Retained Earnings**.

The entry is created after the [Income Statement](financial-statements#income-statement), and before the [Balance Sheet](financial-statements#balance-sheet), as otherwise there will be nothing to display.

<ACCTExample title="Example Closing Entry">
Considering the following adjusted trial balance at the end of the period:

|**Account** | **Debit** | **Credit** |
|--- | --- | --- |
|Cash | \$5 |  |
|Revenue |  | \$15 |
|Expense | \$5 |  |
|Dividends | \$5 |  |
|**Total** | \$15 | \$15 |

We make the following closing entry:

<JournalEntry entries={[
    {
        date: "Dec 31, 2023",
        debit: [["Revenue", "$15"]],
        credit: [
            ["Retained Earnings", "$5"],
            ["Expense", "$5"],
            ["Dividends", "$5"]
        ],
    }
]} />
