!!! note "Operating system"

    The operating system (OS) is a software that controls the execution of programs and manages hardware resources. It allows a computer to be used efficiently and conveniently.
    
    Services provided by the OS:
    * Program Creation – through compilers, assemblers, editors, debuggers etc.
    * Program Execution – through loading programs into memory and preparing resources for the program
    * I/O Access – through providing a uniform I/O interface while the implementation is left to the OS
    * File System Management
    * System Access – control access to system resources to prevent unauthorised users
    * Error Detection and Responsde
    * Accounting – collecting usage statistics and monitoring performance parameters

!!! info "OS Protection Scheme"

    Most OSs uses two modes of operation: user mode and kernel mode. The CPU will execute in different modes to facilitate protection. Some OSs may use up to four modes. Some resources are only accessible in kernel mode.

    An OS is supposed to be well-tested, while bugs may exist in user programs.

    OS functions are usually accessed via special entry points called **system calls**. Upon a system call, the CPU will switch from user mode to kernel mode.

!!! info "Process scheduling"

    To fully utilise the CPU, the CPU is shared among multiple processes. Each process is given a time slice to execute.

    When it uses up its time slice, the CPU will suspend the execution and switch to another process.

    The OS maintains a queue of processes in which the order of execution depends on several factors, such as priority,waiting time, whether the process has used up its time slice (i.e. CPU-bound jobs), the current system load, etc.

## Virtual memory

The demand of memory is often greater than available physical memory. **Virtual memory** is a technique involving the use of *secondary storage* to simulate additional memory. 

!!! info "Physical and logical address"

    **Physical** addresses are addresses to the physical memory, which is smaller.

    **Logical** addresses - addressing space for the program. (e.g. if 32-bit addresses are used, addressing space is $0-4G$).

!!! tip "Paging and page table"

    The OS divides the logical address space into fixed-size blocks called **pages**. The physical memory is divided into blocks of the same size called **frames**.

    When a program is loaded, the OS will load the pages into frames. The mapping between pages and frames is stored in a **page table**.

    When a program accesses a page, the OS will check if it is in memory. If not, it will load the page from disk to memory. This is called **paging**.

    The OS will also keep track of which pages are in memory and which are not. This is called **page replacement**.
