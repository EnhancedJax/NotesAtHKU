## Computer components

!!! note "Overview of components"

    System bus connects *CPU*, *memory*, and *I/O devices*.

    The key design concepts of Von Neumann architecture are:
    - Data and instructions are stored in a **single** read-write *memory*.
    - The contents of memory are addressable by location.
    - Execution occurs in sequential fashion.

!!! note "Key terms"

    - **Byte**: 8 bits
    - **Word**: Unit of memory, e.g. 32-bit word
    - **Registers**: Small amount of fast storage inside CPU.
    - **Buffer**: Temporary storage for data.

!!! tip "Storage inside CPU"

    | Short | Name                       | Holds                                                                 |
    |---|---|---|
    | PC    | Program Counter            | Address of next instruction                                             |
    | IR    | Instruction Register       | Current instruction                                               |
    | MAR   | Memory Address Register    | Address of memory location                                        |
    | MBR   | Memory Buffer Register     | Data to be written to memory or data read from memory             |
    | I/O AR | I/O Address Register      | Address of I/O device                                             |
    | I/O BR | I/O Buffer Register       | Data to be written to/read from I/O device   |


## Instructions

!!! tip "Instruction format"

    Instructions executed by CPU is in **32-bit** binary format:
    ```math
    \underbrace{\text{[  Operator code (OC)  ]}}_{1\text{ byte}}\underbrace{\text{[  Source operand 1 (src1)  ]}}_{1\text{ byte}}\underbrace{\text{[  Source operand 2 (src2)  ]}}_{1\text{ byte}}\underbrace{\text{[  Result destination (dst)  ]}}_{1\text{ byte}}
    ```
    The value from *source operands* will be operated on with the operator referenced by the *operator code* and the result will be stored in the *result destination*.

!!! info "Operations"

    | Operator | Code | Hex Code | Description |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | ADD      | 0000 (0) | 0x00 | Add src1 src2 |
    | SUB      | 0001 (1) | 0x01 | Subtract operands |
    | AND     | 0010 (2) | 0x02 | Bitwise AND |
    | OR      | 0011 (3) | 0x03 | Bitwise OR |
    | NOT    | 0100 (4) | 0x04 | Bitwise NOT |
    | MOV    | 0101 (5) | 0x05 | Move src1 $\to$ dst. src2 = `0x00` | 
    | LD       | 0110 (6) | 0x06 | Load src2 $\to$ dst from memory. src1 = `0x00` |
    | ST       | 0111 (7) | 0x07 | Store src1 $\to$ src2 in memory. dst = `0x00` |
    !!! eg "Example ADD"
    
        `0000 0001 0010 0011` represents an addition (0000) of the numbers in memory locations 2 (0010) and 3 (0011) and store the result in memory location 1 (0001).

        The instruction might sometimes also be expressed in hex format: `0x0123`.
    
    !!! eg "Example LD"
    
        `0110 0000 0010 0001` represents loading the value from memory location 2 (0010) into memory location 1 (
        0001).

WHAT IS 2 WORD????

!!! info "Branch / jump instructions"

    A **condition code** is used to determine if a branch should be taken, placed in *src1*.

    | Operator | Code | Hex Code | Description |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | BR | 1000 (8) | 0x08 | Branch to address in src2 regardless |
    | BZ | 1001 (9) | 0x09 | Branch to address in src2 if previous operation is zero |
    | BNZ | 1010 (10) | 0x0A | Branch to address in src2 if previous operation is not zero |

## Execution cycle

!!! info "Instruction Address Calculation (IAC)"

    - To determine the address of the next instruction, this address is usually stored in a special register called the **Program Counter (PC)**.
    - The **PC** is automatically incremented during the execution cycle.
    - If the instruction is 4 bytes and the memory is byte-addressable, **add 4** to the previous address.
    - For a two-word instruction:
        - The second word is pointed to by the **PC**.
        - The **PC** is incremented again after reading the second word so that it points to the next instruction.
    - **Explicit and Implicit Reference**:
    - In most cases, the next instruction reference is implicit.
    - Explicit reference happens for instructions involving transfer of control, such as **goto**, **if-then-else**, or **function calls**.



!!! info "Instruction Fetch (IF)"

    - The instruction is fetched from memory using the address given by the **PC**.
    - Sequence of operations:
    - **MAR ← PC**: The **Memory Address Register (MAR)** is loaded with the address from **PC**.
    - **IR ← mem[MAR]**: The **Instruction Register (IR)** is loaded with the content of memory at the location specified by **MAR**.
    - **Key Registers**:
    - **MAR**: Holds the address for the memory operation.
    - **mem[MAR]**: Refers to the content of memory at the location specified by **MAR**.
    - **IR**: Holds the instruction to be executed.



!!! info "Instruction Decode"

    - Instructions are represented in a 32-bit binary pattern, e.g., `0000 0110 0000 0000 1111 1111 0000 0100`.
    - The leftmost 8 bits represent the operation (e.g., ADD).
    - The subsequent 8 bits represent operand locations (e.g., 2 source operands and 1 destination operand).
    - The **Control Unit** decodes the operations and sets up the required data movement or processing.
    - The decoded operations are dispatched by the control unit at the appropriate time during execution.



!!! info "Operand Address Calculation"

    - Operands can be located in either **Memory** or **Registers** (inside the CPU):
    - **Registers**:
        - Referenced by register number (e.g., `R11` for register 11).
        - No calculation is needed for registers.
    - **Memory**:
        - Requires an address for the operand.
        - Sometimes the actual address is not provided, and a calculation may be needed (e.g., `address = content of register 10 + A`).
        - The **ALU** may be used for address calculations (e.g., ADD or SUB operations).



!!! info "Operand Fetch"

    - Operands are fetched into temporary registers inside the CPU for **data movement**.
    - Most operations require two source operands:
    - If an operand is in memory:
        - Move the calculated address to **MAR**.
        - Perform a memory read: **MBR ← mem[MAR]**.
        - The **Memory Buffer Register (MBR)** holds the result of the memory read, which is then moved to a temporary register.
    - If an operand is in a register:
        - Read it directly from the **Register File (RF)** using the register number as the address.



!!! info "Operand Fetch — Registers"

    - Example: `ADD R4, R5, R6`
    - The address of the first operand (`R4`) is fed to the **Register File (RF)**, and an RF read is performed.
    - The data is moved via the system bus to input 1 of the **ALU**.
    - Similarly, the address of the second operand (`R5`) is fed to the RF, and the data is moved to input 2 of the ALU.



!!! info "Operand Fetch — Memory"

    - Example: Two-word instruction `0x0600ff04 0000003c`:
    - Addresses for these words could be 300 and 304.
    - For the instruction `LD 0x0000003c, R4`:
        - After fetching the instruction, the **PC** points to the next word (`0x0000003c`).
        - Read this address from memory:
        - **MAR ← PC**: Load PC's content into MAR.
        - **MBR ← mem[MAR]**: Read memory, storing the result (`0x0000003c`) in MBR.
    - If `0x0000003c` is an address (not the operand itself), perform another memory read:
    - **MAR ← MBR**: Use MBR's content as the new address.
    - **MBR ← mem[MAR]**: Read memory again to fetch the operand.



!!! info "Execute"

    - Perform the **Arithmetic/Logic operation** for the instruction:
    - Source operands are retrieved from temporary storage inside the CPU.
    - These values are fed to the **Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU)** for data processing.
    - The output of the ALU is stored in a temporary register.



!!! info "Operand Write Back"

    - If the destination operand is in a **register**:
    - Move the data from the ALU output to the input of the **Register File (RF)**.
    - Perform an RF write using the address from byte 3 of the instruction.
    - If the destination operand is in **memory**:
    - Calculate the address (if needed).
    - Move the data to **MBR**.
    - Write back to memory: **mem[MAR] ← MBR**.



!!! info "Interrupt"

    - Interrupts allow the CPU to stop the current instruction execution and attend to other tasks, improving efficiency:
    - Example scenarios:
        - Immediate attention needed for I/O operations (e.g., data from the network).
        - Time-sharing systems where the CPU is shared among multiple programs.
    - **How Interrupts Work**:
    - I/O devices generate an interrupt signal to the CPU.
    - During processing, the system remembers the current program's state (e.g., register values).
    - After serving the interrupt, the system restores the state and resumes execution.
    - Interrupt handlers can be:
    - **Hardware Interrupts**.
    - **Software Interrupts** (operating system level).
