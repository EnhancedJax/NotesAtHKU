## Computer components

!!! note "Overview of components"

    System bus connects *CPU*, *memory*, and *I/O devices*.

    The key design concepts of Von Neumann architecture are:
    - Data and instructions are stored in a **single** read-write *memory*.
    - The contents of memory are addressable by location.
    - Execution occurs in sequential fashion.

!!! note "Key terms"

    - **Byte**: 8 bits
    - **Word**: Unit of memory, e.g. 32-bit word
    - **Registers**: Small amount of fast storage inside CPU.
    - **Buffer**: Temporary storage for data.

!!! tip "Storage inside CPU"

    | Short | Name                       | Holds                                                                 |
    |---|---|---|
    | PC    | Program Counter            | Address of next instruction                                             |
    | IR    | Instruction Register       | Current instruction                                               |
    | MAR   | Memory Address Register    | Address of memory location                                        |
    | MBR   | Memory Buffer Register     | Data to be written to memory or data read from memory             |
    | I/O AR | I/O Address Register      | Address of I/O device                                             |
    | I/O BR | I/O Buffer Register       | Data to be written to/read from I/O device   |


## Instructions

!!! tip "Instruction format"

    Instructions executed by CPU is in **32-bit** binary format:
    ```math
    \underbrace{\text{[  Operator code (OC)  ]}}_{1\text{ byte}}\underbrace{\text{[  Source operand 1 (src1)  ]}}_{1\text{ byte}}\underbrace{\text{[  Source operand 2 (src2)  ]}}_{1\text{ byte}}\underbrace{\text{[  Result destination (dst)  ]}}_{1\text{ byte}}
    ```
    The value from *source operands* will be operated on with the operator referenced by the *operator code* and the result will be stored in the *result destination*.

!!! info "Operations"

    | Operator | Code | Hex Code | Description |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | ADD      | 0000 (0) | 0x00 | Add src1 src2 |
    | SUB      | 0001 (1) | 0x01 | Subtract operands |
    | AND     | 0010 (2) | 0x02 | Bitwise AND |
    | OR      | 0011 (3) | 0x03 | Bitwise OR |
    | NOT    | 0100 (4) | 0x04 | Bitwise NOT |
    | MOV    | 0101 (5) | 0x05 | Move src1 $\to$ dst. src2 = `0x00` | 
    | LD       | 0110 (6) | 0x06 | Load src2 $\to$ dst from memory. src1 = `0x00` |
    | ST       | 0111 (7) | 0x07 | Store src1 $\to$ src2 in memory. dst = `0x00` |
    !!! eg "Example ADD"
    
        `0000 0001 0010 0011` represents an addition (0000) of the numbers in memory locations 2 (0010) and 3 (0011) and store the result in memory location 1 (0001).

        The instruction might sometimes also be expressed in hex format: `0x0123`.
    
    !!! eg "Example LD"
    
        `0110 0000 0010 0001` represents loading the value from memory location 2 (0010) into memory location 1 (
        0001).

WHAT IS 2 WORD????

!!! info "Branch / jump instructions"

    A **condition code** is used to determine if a branch should be taken, placed in *src1*.

    | Operator | Code | Hex Code | Description |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | BR | 1000 (8) | 0x08 | Branch to address in src2 regardless |
    | BZ | 1001 (9) | 0x09 | Branch to address in src2 if previous operation is zero |
    | BNZ | 1010 (10) | 0x0A | Branch to address in src2 if previous operation is not zero |
