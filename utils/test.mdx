title: Limits and Continuity

## Introduction to the concept of limit
<HLayout><div>
We can conceptualize that the limit of a function $f(x)$ is $L$ as $x$ approaches $c$, given that we can make $f(x)$ *as close to $L$ as we want* for all $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, from both sides, *without actually letting $x$ be $a$*. We can write this as:
```math
\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L
```

## One-sided limits
There are two sides that $x$ can tend to a number. We can write it as $x\to n^-$ and $x\to n^+$, which represents from the negative (left) / positive (right) side.
## Existence of limits

<Block variant="theorem" title="Condition for limit to exist">
The limit for a function $f(x)$ only exists if and only if:
```math
\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)
```
WARNING: If the **limit is** $\mathbf{\infty}$ it **doesn't exist**.
</Block>
<HLayout><div>
For this example, when $x\to 0^-, y\to -\infty$.
Similarly, as $x\to 0^+, y\to +\infty$.
Hence, we can conclude that the limit for this function as $x\to 0$ doesn't exist.

## Continuity

<Block variant="definition" title="Continuity">
A function $f(x)$ is *continuous* at $x=a$ if:
```math
\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to a} f\left( x \right) = f\left( a \right)
```
</Block>

<Block variant="knBox" title="Continuity properties">
For $f,g$ continuous at $c$, the following are also continuous at $c$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f \pm g$
\item $kf$
\item $fg$
\item $\frac{f}{g}$, given that $g(c)\ne 0$
\end{enumerate}
</Block>

<Block variant="theorem" title="Intermediate value theorem (IVT)">
If a function $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, there is a number $c$ in $[a, b]$ where $f(c)$ in $[f(a), f(b)]$.
We use the IVT by first finding $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then apply the rule.
<BlockSep />
To prove that there is a root, we can use the IVT by showing there is a **change of sign** between the interval given.

## Computing limits


<Block variant="definition" title="Indeterminate forms">
Indeterminate forms are forms that cannot be solved by simply substituting the value of $x$ into the function. They are:
```math
\frac{0}{0},\quad\frac{\infty}{\infty},\quad0\cdot\infty,\quad\infty-\infty,\quad\infty^0,\quad1^\infty,\quad\infty^0
```
Note that $\infty + \infty = \infty$. Related: \hyperref[sec:lhr]{L'Hopital's rule}
</Block>

<Block variant="theorem" title="Using the limit laws">
For functions $f,g$ and using $\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to a}=\bigcirc$ for simpler notation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $lim_{x\to a}c=c$
\item $\bigcirc(f\pm g)=\bigcirc f\pm \bigcirc g$
\item $\bigcirc(k\cdot f)=\bigcirc k\cdot\bigcirc f$
\item $\bigcirc(f^n)=(\bigcirc f)^n$
\item $\bigcirc(fg)=\bigcirc f\bigcirc g$
\item $\bigcirc(\frac{f}{g})=\frac{\bigcirc f}{\bigcirc g},\quad\text{given that }\bigcirc g\ne 0$. *This strict condition prevents indeterminate forms.*
\end{enumerate}
We can use these laws to break a limit into separate limits, and compute that way. Also note that:
\begin{enumerate}[start=7]
\item $\bigcirc f(g)=f(\bigcirc g),\quad$given that $f$ is **continuous** at $\bigcirc g$
\end{enumerate}
</Block>

<Block variant="theorem" title="Limit of a polynomial">
For the limit of a polynomial $p(x)$:
```math
lim_{x\to a}p(x)=p(a)
```
This can be proven easily with the limit laws above.
</Block>

<Block variant="knBox" title="Techniques to compute limits">
To solve for limits, we have to get the expression to the right form - a polynomial, for us to substitute our limit value into the function.
To do this, often we have to **factorize** or **rationalize**.
</Block>

<Block variant="knBox" title="Limits of composite functions">
For the limit of a composite function $\lim_{x\to a}f(g(x))$, where $f$ is **not** continuous at $g(a)$, we find $b$ as $x\to a,g\to b$, and then find $\lim_{x\to b}f(x)$ at that value.
The following explains some common cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x\to a^-, g\to g(a)^-$
\item $x\to a^-, -x\to -a^+$
\end{enumerate}
For $y=\lim_{x\to a}f(x)^{g(x)}$, we can the logarithm to simplify the function, and determine $\lim_{x\to a}\ln y$ and find $\lim_{x\to a}y=e^{\lim_{x\to a}\ln y}$.
</Block>

<Block variant="knBox" title="Limits of square roots">
To solve for limits of square roots, we can multiply by the conjugate to rationalize the function.
```math
\lim_{x\to a}f(x)+\sqrt{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f^2(x)-g(x)}{f(x)-\sqrt{g(x)}}
```
</Block>

<Block variant="theorem" title="The squeeze / sandwich theorem">
Suppose $f(x)\le g(x) \le h(x)$ in the range $[a, b]$, for $c$ in $[a, b]$:
```math
\lim_{x\to c}f \le \lim_{x\to c}g \le \lim_{x\to c}h
```
We will make use of the fact that the limits can be equal to solve for the limit of $g(x)$.
</Block>

Squeezing a function
When we can't seem to factorize a function, we can try squeezing it between two other functions.
```math
\lim_{x\to 0}x^2\cos\frac{1}{x}
```
We know the limits of the function $\cos \frac{1}{x}$, so we can start from there.
```math
\text{Given that }x\ne 0, -1\le \cos \frac{1}{x} \le 1
```
```math
\text{Multiplying }x^2\text{ on both sides},-x^2\le \cos x^2\frac{1}{x} \le x^2
```
```math
\text{As }\lim_{x\to 0}\pm x^2=0,\quad\text{we can conclude that }\lim_{x\to 0}x^2\cos\frac{1}{x}=0
```
</Block>
## Infinite limits

<Block variant="knBox" title="Determining infinite limits">
If $f(x)$ gets (negatively) arbitrarily large when $x$ approaches $a$, we can say:
```math
\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=(-)\infty
```
After we know that the limit *may* be infinity, we then have to make sure that *the limit is the same from both sides*, so that the limit is actually $\infty$. We can do so by plugging numbers which are approaching the limit from both sides.
</Block>
<HLayout><div>
\begin{example}
Infinite limit exists
```math
\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{6}{x^2}
```
```math
\text{Consider both}\ \lim_{x\to 0^-}\frac{6}{x^2},\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{6}{x^2}:
```
```math
\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{6}{x^2}=\infty
```
\end{example}
</div>
<div>
\begin{example}
Infinite limit doesn't exist
```math
\lim_{x\to 4}\frac{3}{(4-x)^3}
```
\begin{center}
Checking both sides, we can conclude that the limit doesn't exist, as:
\end{center}
```math
\lim_{x\to 4^+}\frac{3}{(4-x)^3}=-\infty,\quad\lim_{x\to 4^-}\frac{3}{(4-x)^3}=\infty
```
\end{example}
</div></HLayout>
## Limits at infinity

<Block variant="theorem" title="Infinity operations">
Note the following operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\infty + k=\infty$
\item For $k<0,\ k\infty=-\infty$
\item $-\infty\times\infty=-\infty$
\end{enumerate}
</Block>

<Block variant="knBox" title="Determining limits of infinity">
It is not hard to see that, for rational numbers $n$:
```math
\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{k}{x^n}=0
```
The easiest way to determine the limit would be to *factorize* the function so that we can use the fact above.
</Block>

<Block variant="theorem" title="Determining limits of infinity of polynomials">
Using the above fact, we can see that for a polynomial $p(x)$ with degree $n$ and largest coefficient $a_n$:
```math
\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}p(x)=a_nx^n
```
Which means we can *only consider the largest term in a polynomial* for limits of infinity.
</Block>

Indeterminate forms by substitution of infinity
Substituting $\infty$ into the function gives $\infty-\infty-\infty$, which is indeterminate. Hence, we must factorize it.
```math
\lim_{x\to\infty}2x^4-x^2-8x & =\lim_{x\to\infty}[x^4(2-\frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{8}{x^3})] \\
& =\infty\times 2                                        \\
& =\infty
```
Or we can just simply use the theorem above and consider $\lim_{x\to\infty}2x^4$ only to give $\infty$.
</Block>

Factor polynomials limit to infinity
We can simply consider the largest terms on each side and give the final answer easily.
```math
\lim_{x \to -\infty } \frac{{\sqrt {3{x^2} + 6} }}{{5 - 2x}} & =\lim_{x \to -\infty }\frac{\sqrt{3x^2}}{-2x}                           \\
& =\lim_{x \to -\infty }\frac{\sqrt{3}|x|}{-2x} \leftarrow \sqrt{x^2}=|x| \\
& =\lim_{x \to -\infty }\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{-2} \leftarrow |c|,c<0=-c        \\
& =\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
```
Note that, as we are considering the negative limit of infinity, we need to add - to the abs sign on line 3.

## Asymptotes

<Block variant="definition" title="Vertical asymptotes">
$f$ will have v-asymptotes at $x=a$ if any $\pm$ is true:
```math
\lim_{x\to a^\pm}f(x)=\pm\infty
```
</Block>

<Block variant="definition" title="Horizontal asymptotes">
$f$ will have h-asymptotes at $y=L$ if any $\pm$ is true:
```math
\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}f(x)=L
```
